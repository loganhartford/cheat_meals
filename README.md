## Overview

CheatScore is a Python application that helps users find nearby fast food meals based on their location and craving level. The app utilizes the Google Places API to retrieve nearby restaurant data and a local dataset for meal nutrition information. It allows users to input their location, set a search radius, and quantify their craving level on a scale of 1 to 10.

The app provides users with a list of meal options from the selected restaurants, displaying them as cards with basic information. Users can click on a card to view detailed nutrition information, including caloric spread, caloric density, and a comparison of actual values to daily recommended values for various nutrients.

Additionally, the app provides a convenient button to open directions to the restaurant location using Google Maps.
