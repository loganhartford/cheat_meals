## Overview

CheatScore is a Python application that helps users find nearby fast food meals based on their location and craving level. The app utilizes the Google Places API to retrieve restaurant data and a local dataset for meal nutrition information. It allows users to input their location, set a search radius, and quantify their craving level on a scale of 1 to 10.

The app provides users with a list of meal options from the selected restaurants, displaying them as cards with basic information. Users can click on a card to view detailed nutrition information, including caloric spread, caloric density, and a comparison of actual values to daily recommended values for various nutrients.

Additionally, the app provides a convenient button to open directions to the restaurant location using Google Maps.

- Radius selection: Users can set a search radius to find fast food restaurants within a specific distance from their location.
- Craving score: Users can quantify their craving level on a scale of 1 to 10, which helps in finding appropriate meal options.

## Future Improvements

- Database integration: Currently, the meal nutrition dataset is stored locally. Consider integrating a database to store and retrieve the nutrition information for improved scalability and flexibility.
- Enhanced search functionality: Implement advanced search options, such as filtering by specific nutrients or dietary requirements.
- User preferences and profiles: Allow users to save their preferences and create profiles to personalize the app experience.
- User interface enhancements: Improve the user interface by adding more interactive features, better styling, and visualizations.
